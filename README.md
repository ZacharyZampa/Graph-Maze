Java Graph Class

This graph class creates an unweighted Graph that can be directed or undirected based on the user's desire.

The Maze program provides a visual and modifiable example of the graph in action when used for finding a path between a source and destination vertex.
Left Click places walls, Right and Middle click places the source and destination vertices. Then click the button and it will find a path. The path is shown as white boxes.
